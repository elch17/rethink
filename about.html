		<h1><strong>About Us</strong></h1></br>

		<h2><strong>What does RETHINK PINK do?</strong></h2>
		 <p>
We are a non-profit organization which seeks to support women of all backgrounds and ages in Bristol. We rely on donations from businesses and information from the public to provide women with information to essential services.  Our services revolve around menstruation and sexual health.  As a university student, I have noticed a lack of information among my peers of sexual health clinics.  While menstrual products are a basic natural necessity for women they are discriminatorily taxed and many women cannot afford the expense.  We also strive to change the stigmatization around the conservation of menstruation. We have also listed UK Hotline Numbers for access to at-risk, vulnerable women.   RETHINK PINK has compiled these resources for easy accessibility so women can make more informed educated decisions and empowering sexual wellbeing through personal bodily autonomy. <p>

			<h2><strong>Our services</strong></h2>

		<ol>
		<h><em> <li><strong> Sexual health clinics </strong></li></em> </h>
		  <p>Women's sexuality is often weaponized to create political, cultural and religious wedge issues.  Often women do not feel as if their sexuality and sexual wellbeing is their own.  The female experience is heavily stigmatized and often dismissed.  It is our aim to provide women with the resources to take control of their sexual health thereby attain sexual empowerment.  We provide facilities, private and NHS affiliated that offer services including emergency contraception, sexual and reproductive health screenings, and STI testing.     </p>

		<h><em> <li> <strong> Menstrual Products </strong> </em></li></h>
		<p> According to Plan International UK 1 in 10 girls can't afford to buy menstrual products.  Menstrual products are basic, unavoidable necessities for women's natural biological function.  It is estimated women will spend £18,000, in her lifetime (£13 every month).  We provide a map of where to buy the cheapest menstrual products in Bristol.  </p>

		<h><em> <li> <strong> Emergency Contact Information </strong> </em></li></h>
			<p>RETHINK PINK aims to provide women with access to services that support vulnerable women.  It is essential that at-risk women are provided with assistance and know where to find help.  We hope to give women a network where they can get the help they need for their situation. </p>
		</ol>

		<h2> <strong> Why is this important? </strong> </h2>
		<p> The stigma around periods has made them only discussed in hushed whispers if discussed at all.  A survey found nearly half were embarrassed by their period and many were afraid to ask for help because of the stigma.  If a girl missed school every time she has her period she is set 145 days behind her male peers.  Over 137,700 children in the UK have missed school because of period poverty.  This situation is exacerbated in women who experience poverty, who are one of the most vulnerable groups.  In order to create significant change, we need to normalize conversations around periods so girls are not afraid to ask about periods and seek out help if needed.  We hope RETHINK PINK helps girls make that first step and know where to find the resources they need for their wellbeing. </p>
